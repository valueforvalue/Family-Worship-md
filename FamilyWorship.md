## Preface

In the first place I would like to address the objections to family worship, I do so for myself in the future if ever (God forbid) I
am inclined to neglect this solemn duty.

 In doing so I will quote a very informative section from The Importance of Family Religion by: S.G. Winchester.

> The first objection we shall notice, is the want of time, properly and statedly to perform this duty.
> It may be safely taken for granted, that there can not be conflicting duties. That which an undoubted duty renders
> impossible to be done, can not itself be duty. This would suppose derangement in the government and plans of God, which is
> wholly inadmissible. If, then, family worship be an obvious duty, we can not be warranted in occupying the time in which it
> should be performed, in doing any thing else. If it be a duty at all, it must also be a duty to employ some time in performing it,
> and it can not be our duty to employ this time in doing something else. Whatever we do, therefore, when we should be
> attending to family devotion, is sinfully done, and in direct opposition to the will of God; and to plead the one as an excuse for
> the neglect of the other, is to plead one sin in extenuation of another. The time which should be employed in serving God, is
> his time, and not ours. When he demands a service, he also demands the necessary time for its performance. This is evident.
> Now if that time be otherwise employed, it is withholding from God that which is his due. It is robbing God of what rightfully
> belongs to him. If your servant should neglect to perform the service for which you have bargained with him, and plead the
> want of time as his excuse, what would be your reply? Would it not be—"in bargaining for your service, I bargained for all the
> time that the service requires; and to appropriate that time to your own or other purposes, is to deprive me of what is my
> legal and rightful due?" If this would be your reply, as I apprehend it would be, then you have furnished an answer to your
> own objection. On what ground do you presume upon success in any business, that is transacted at the expense of God’s
> rights? Should you prosper in life, notwithstanding this disregard of his claim, may you not justly conclude that he is
> permitting you to fill up the cup of your iniquity, and that he has deferred the settlement of his account with you, to the day of
> righteous retribution? May not your success in worldly gain, be regarded as a fearful premonition of coming vengeance? You
> may have, as many others have, your portion in this life. What an awful thought! What a still more awful reality!!
>
> If the business in which you are engaged, be an unlawful calling, how greatly aggravated is the guilt of occupying God’s
> time in prosecuting it! Men, generally, are not sufficiently impressed with a sense of their entire dependence on God; for
> success in their worldly affairs. They acknowledge it as a theoretic truth, but are not habitually influenced by the belief of it.
> "Except God build the. house, they labour in vain that build it." Ps. 127:1. Men are also slow to credit that important
> declaration of Scripture, "Godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to
> come." They do not practically believe the promise annexed to the injunction; "seek first the kingdom of God and his
> righteousness, AND ALL THESE THINGS SHALL BE ADDED UNTO YOU." This objection is not unlike that which Judas made to
> Mary’s anointing the head and feet of Christ with precious ointment. He thought it might be otherwise employed to greater
> advantage. But Christ said, "wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this
> woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her." This objection asks, "to what purpose is this waste" of time? Judas, indeed,
> in making the objection, professed great solicitude for the poor, to whose relief he supposed the price of the ointment might
> be more piously applied. But here the objector supposes that the time required for family devotion, might be otherwise
> employed to his own advantage or even should he propose to employ that time in acts of charity, or in acquiring means of
> benevolent relief to the needy, still it may be asked, does God require you to do good by neglecting duty, or to do evil that
> good may come of it?· Does he require you to do his will in one respect, by disregarding it in another? Certainly not. Let the
> objector examine carefully and prayerfully, his own heart, and he will find that the difficulty is a want of disposition, not a want of time.

## Introduction

### Purpose of Family Worship

It is my utmost desire to conduct family worship in a manner which will ultimately further the Glory of our Lord. Though I
know my own sinfulness shall ultimately hinder the progress which I hope to make. May the Lord grant me strength in
shepherding the family he has committed to my trust. It is my firm belief he will do so in all faithfulness and that any flaw in
the execution or the results of the undertaking will be my own doing. May we never forget the blessed gift our Lord has given
us in allowing us to worship him. May I faithfully make use of the grace he so mercifully bestows.

The ultimate purpose for family as I understand it is to seek a Godly seed, may our family be fertile soil for the Word of God
to take solid root. S. G. Winchester in his: The Importance of Family Religion stated it as follows:


>GOD, the Creator of man, established the family constitution. "God setteth the solitary in families," Ps. 68:6. As to the
>design of this constitution, we are expressly informed in Malachi 2:15. "And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of
>the Spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed." And it is declared that "a seed shall serve him," Ps. 22:30.
>When God ordains an end, all the means requisite for its accomplishment are necessarily implied, and sometimes specifically
>prescribed. If then the design of God, in the family constitution, be to raise up a holy seed to serve him, it is incumbent on
>those who have the charge of families to train them up with a special view to this declared end, otherwise it would be
>presumption to expect that this end will be answered.

## Direction

### Reminder

I make it my purpose from henceforth to conduct the family worship in such a way as to eliminate a woodenness of
worship, which in my estimation would harden the hearts of both young and old worshipers toward a most merciful and
faithful Saviour and Lord. That being said, I consider it my duty to conduct our family worship in such a manner as to instill an
awe and reverence toward our Lord and Saviour. Therefore care must be taken in the method of worship, order must be set
forth in its execution to make known the seriousness of the undertaking. However order must not be practiced in excess, as
it would tend to legalism or a ritualism which would veil the mercy and loving-kindness of the Lord our God, and hinder the
grace so mercifully bestowed upon us by his Holy Spirit.

### Prayer for the Lord's blessing:

Merciful Heavenly Father, I humbly ask your blessing upon the method of family worship I will describe here. I thank you
for the gift of worship, and ask for your guidance in its proper execution. We are sinful and wretched, deserving to be brought
to nothing before you, the most Holy one. Father I ask that you restrain our sinfulness, purify us so that we may be pleasing in
your sight. Conform us to the image of your Son our blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by the power of your Holy Spirit. I
pray these things in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen

## Formal Worship

### Preparation for Worship

Each member of the household should engage in a private prayer with the Lord before coming to worship corporately.
They should do so to promote a proper spirit, one of reverence and awe for the Lord and the reading of his Word.

### Call to Worship

The call to worship will be done, ordinarily, by reading from the Psalms. [Psalm 95, 96, 100 as examples.]

### Salutation

The salutation will be one from scripture such as: "Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ." or "Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord."

### Opening Prayer

The opening prayer will ask God to be present in the worship service by the power of his Holy Spirit, through which we
are sanctified and conformed to the image of Christ. Thanking him for the mediatorship of his Son Jesus Christ which enabled
us to be reconciled to God and be called his children.

The prayer of approach to God in response to his call to enter his presence for worship should express humble adoration,
confess unworthiness and
inability to worship aright. It should seek God's merciful acceptance through Jesus Christ, and invoke gracious working of
the Holy Spirit.

Pray for illumination by the Holy Spirit. And the application of the Word to the minds, hearts, and lives of the hearers.
Give thanks for the Word of Life.

### Scripture Reading

There will be a Scripture reading from the New and Old Testaments. Specific sections of Scripture will be selected
beforehand. The Law of God will be frequently read, proceeded by a prayer of confession of sins.

* Unison reading of Psalms addressed to Gods people read in an alternating per stanza form will be done on occasion.
* Antiphonal reading of Psalms addressed to God from his people read in an alternating per stanza form will be done on occasion.

### Singing

We will be selective in our choice of hymns, they will need to reflect sound doctrine. The Psalms will be a frequent choice.

* **We will** sing with and from our heart to the Lord.
* **We will** sing for the Glory of God, and the building up of the saints.
* **We will not** sing for entertainment or to praise men.

### Mini-Sermon

 The exposition of the Lords word will be done in each worship service in accordance with the head of households ability.

* Remember not to separate Christian duty from Christian faith.
* Proclaim the Gospel without adulteration.
* The whole council of God is to be expounded.
* Warn of the dangers of the enemy.
* Take care to emphasize Christ and his sacrifice, to the exclusion of works and earthly wisdom.

### Benediction

The benediction is not simply a prayer, it is an announcement of the grace bestowed by God upon his children. It should
be proceeded with thankfulness to God for his grace and innumerable blessings. [Num 6:24-26 or 2 Cor 13:14]

* The grace principle and the Immanuel principle are still in effect. "I will be a God to you, and you will be my people."
* The Immanuel principle is secured in Christ our Saviour.
* We are not our own we belong to Christ.
* His name is written upon us.

### Notes on Prayer

* In order for prayer to be accepted by God, prayer is to be by faith, in the name of the Son of God, by the help of his
Spirit, and according to God's will.

* The prayer of approach to God in response to his call to enter his presence for worship should express humble adoration,
confess unworthiness and inability to worship aright. It should seek God's merciful acceptance through Jesus Christ, and
invoke gracious working of the Holy Spirit.

* The reading of God's law should be proceeded with a prayer of confession of sin.

* Pray for forgiveness through the blood, and a renewal through the Holy Spirit. Intercede for others including but not
limited to brethren. Pray in thanksgiving for mercies received, lament in times of distress.

* Pray for illumination by the Holy Spirit. And the application of the Word to the minds, hearts, and lives of the hearers.
Give thanks for the Word of Life.

## Informal Worship

### Catechism Questions

We will engage in a systematic study of the Larger and Smaller Catechisms, as well as the one for Boys and Girls. In
doing so we hope to be more prepared to give a reason for the hope that is in us and to be better equipped to further the
glory of our Lord in all the earth.

### Confession of Faith

To better understand the fundamental doctrine of our faith we will engage in a systematic study of the Westminster
confession of faith, and also the 1689 London Baptist confession.

### Creeds

We will memorize the Apostles Creed or the Nicene Creed for the purpose of orderly public confession of our faith.
